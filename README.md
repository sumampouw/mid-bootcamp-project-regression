## The objectives

This project aims to perform an end-to-end analysis putting into practice what I have learned in regression.

### The outcomes in this project:

Act as an analyst for a real estate company. The company wants to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.

**Task**: To build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset.

The result uses analyzing the data using exploratory data analysis, summarizing the dataset's statistical aspects, machine learning models, and providing insights.

- Analysis in questions and answers.
- Visualizations.
- The best model and insight.

## Dataset

In this project, we will use the data provided [**regression_data.csv**] 
[Here](https://github.com/sumampouw/mid-bootcamp-project-regression/blob/main/data/regression_data.csv)

The data set has information on some 22,000 properties. The dataset consisted of historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015:

## **Housing** data:

1. **regression-housing** data:

    |   |   |
    |---|---|
    | Id: Unique identification number for the property. |
    | date: date the house was sold. |
    | price: price of the house. |
    | waterfront: house which has a view to a waterfront. |
    | condition: How good the condition is (overall). 1 indicates worn out property and 5 excellent. |
    | grade: Overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system. 1 poor ,13 excellent. |
    | Sqft_above: square footage of house apart from basement. |
    | Sqft_living15: Living room area in 2015 (implies - some renovations). This might or might not have affected the lot size area. |
    | Sqft_lot15: Lot size area in 2015 (implies - some renovations). |

The analysis has successfully answered all the questions and has provided an insight into the data. As I always mention that information is everything; hence, we can create, model, and predict to have the best outcomes possible. :wink:
